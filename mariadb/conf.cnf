# * InnoDB

# InnoDB is enabled by default with a 10MB datafile in /var/lib/mysql/.
# Read the manual for more InnoDB related options. There are many!
# Most important is to give InnoDB 80 % of the system RAM for buffer use:

#innodb_buffer_pool_size = 8G

# If you use the same .cnf file for MariaDB of different versions,
